  "description": "The classic problem of N queens, originally published by Max Bezzel in 1848, is defined like this: Place N queens in a NxN chessboard so that no queen threatens any other. A queen threatens another chess piece if they share the same row, column or diagonal. This game is a slight alteration of the N-queens problem: In a NxN chessboard we need to place M queens ( M less than or equal to N) so that no queen threatens another and additionally,all chessboard tiles are threatened by at least one queen.",
